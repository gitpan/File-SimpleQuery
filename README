NAME
    File::SimpleQuery - Query flat-files, simply!

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Have you ever wanted to make queries against a flat-file, similar to a
    database, but did not want to setup all the necessary database
    machinery? Enter File::SimpleQuery, which is intended to allow you to
    make simple sql-like queries against a file you specify.

    Intended to make querying simple files easier. The file in question is
    expected to have the first row be a header row, which is how it knows
    whichs fields to select from.

        use File::SimpleQuery;

        my $delimiter = ',';
        my $filename = 'test_file';
        my $q = File::SimpleQuery->new($filename, $delimiter);

        my @results = $q->select(
            [ qw/ field1 fieldn / ],
            sub { my $fields = shift; return 1 if $fields->{field1} eq 'foo' },
        );

FUNCTIONS
  new
    The constructor. You must specify the filename and the delimiter between
    rows

  select ( \@field_names_to_select, \&where_sub, \@group_by_fields )
    Returns a list of hash-refs that match the lines in the file where the
    where_sub evaluates to true, groupped by the group_by_fields
